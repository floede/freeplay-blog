A new console generation is always an exciting event, but it is as though the current generation of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been a little more reluctant innovations than we are used to. Previously we have moved from 2D to 3D. We have seen our game machines expand the work to include video playback and apps. Online multiplayer, friends lists and voice chat has become standard.

However, this time it has been a little difficult to point to the great achievements after exercise controls went a bit into oblivion again.
But with Horizon Zero Dawn PlayStation 4:01 exclusive title that I think changing the image at least a bit.

You play the young girl Aloy, which initially excluded from the tribe she really belong. And the story has its beginning when Aloy will be old enough to understand that she is different, and she obviously want answers to the question: Why? Answers are not quite so simple to give.

Aloys story takes place well into the future, when something has ended civilization as we know it. Here people live in primitive tribes with different rules of life and cultures that hold them together, but no one knows as a starting point for our world, or at all, that things were different once.
For Aloys people are the ruins where one might find traces of the past, even forbidden and unholy places to avoid.

Perhaps because our age is equal to technology, and for Aloy and everyone else, technology is primarily represented in deadly robots that dominates the open plains. The robots look and behave like animals, but even the smallest of them is deadly to anything but the most trained warrior.

Horizon Zero Dawn is most of all an action in an open world wrapping. I say most of all, for the foundation of the game is to fight against robots or people with a spear for melee and bows and like to attack something at a distance.
But there is also a stealth element so you can sneak up on unsuspecting opponents by hiding in the tall grass. 
There is a great role-playing element in a talenttr√¶, so you can tailor Aloys abilities as you increase in level. There are weapons in different classes with different types of attacks. There is armor with different properties. And both can be improved through the things you get for beating robots to death. 
There is dialogue options so you can influence how your version of Aloy behave among others.
You have a "focus", a small high tech gizmo that resembles the bluetooth headset, rag tag business men sometimes use. Here it gives you in return access to a kind of augmented reality, which serves about things around you, and for example can show the trajectory of robots and humans, so you can better plan where and when to strike with his sneak attack.
But it can also highlight the weak areas of the various robots, so to get an idea of where you may need to aim first. And possibly there are particular vulnerabilities facing the fire, frost or power. 
There is also a special type called "tear" that do not actually damage to the opponent, but instead tear armored plates or parts completely. Extremely useful to expose the more vulnerable parts of a giant robot.

Due to its history and the world's Horizon Zero Dawn definitely a unique experience, but which game is the overall, all things we've seen before.
Far Cry and the new Tomb Raider game is the obvious comparisons, but there are also hints of Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed, Dishonored and Dark Souls or Monster Hunter. Without even having the two latter difficulty.
I also get strong reminiscent of Uncharted, in the liquid way Aloy fight and move on when she climbs up the ruins and cliff sides.

I started to talk a little about the "next gen" because it is most of all, what Horizon Zero Dawn feels like to me. The fact that it pulls more or less elements from a variety of other games, are by no means meant to negative. On the contrary. Here's a game that deliberately adds just enough role playing and stealth to an action to expand the experience without seeming glued on. And while keeping an extremely high quality of all the individual disciplines. I do not think you've seen before done just as well.

The only small negative I have to say is that the fighting against humans is not nearly as interesting as the robots. And it's also a shame that the game puts so much weight that you can sneak around unseen and unnoticed killing invaders, then still occasionally throw you out in situations where history and surroundings makes it impossible to use stealth. 

But it is little comments to a game that otherwise is simply a joy to play.
